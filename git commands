For any new feature
Go to dev folder, where dev app exists

git checkout main       // Go to main branch
Remember I am at moment only working on dev repo. Production is out of question

Here is what i did 
git pull origin main    // Pull latest contents from main branch in dev repo.

git checkout -b feature-hubspoke-mindmap    // create a new branch with feature name <feature-hubspoke-mindmap>

Dit development and made changes there in dev folder

git add .   // Add changes to git
git commit -m "feat: Add the new feature - feature-hubspoke-mindmap". // Do a commit.
push origin feature-hubspoke-mindmap        // Push to feature to branch
