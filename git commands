For any new feature
Go to dev folder, where dev app exists and pull latest changes from you main branch

git checkout main       // Go to main branch
Remember I am at moment only working on dev repo.

git pull origin main    // Pull latest contents from main branch in dev repo.

git checkout -b feature-hubspoke-mindmap    // create a new branch with feature name <feature-hubspoke-mindmap>

Dit development and made changes there in dev folder

git add .   // Add changes to git
git commit -m "feat: Add the new feature - feature-hubspoke-mindmap". // Do a commit.
push origin feature-hubspoke-mindmap        // Push to feature to branch

--------------------------
Now branch has new feature that is already merged to new branch. 
--------------------------
Next step is to merge this feature to main branch. i.e. To have your local main branch now contains the changes from your feature branch.

git checkout main
git merge feature-hubspoke-mindmap
git push origin main
--------------------------
After you merged changes from your feature branch to main branch. You can optionally delete feature from the feature branch.

git branch -d feature-hubspoke-mindmap                  // Delete local branch

git push origin --delete feature-hubspoke-mindmap       // Delete remote branch
